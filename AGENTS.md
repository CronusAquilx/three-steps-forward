## Architecture rules
- All chat models resolve through `src/lib/astra/provider.server.ts` as OpenAI-compatible endpoints configured by env vars (default `AI_BASE_URL`/`AI_API_KEY`/`AI_MODEL`); never hard-code a model or use Lovable AI as a hard dependency — the built-in hosted model is only a fallback used when no self-hosted server is configured.
- Model registry and reasoning levels live in the database (`models`, `reasoning_levels`), so models are added by data, not code.
- Chat streaming goes through the `/api/chat` server route with the user's bearer token; messages persist server-side per thread, and the client sends only the latest message.
- Authenticated pages live under `src/routes/_authenticated/` with `ssr: false`, since the session lives in browser storage.
- Agent tools are defined in `src/lib/astra/tools.server.ts` and gated by rows in the `tools` table (enabled flag), so tools are switched on/off by data.
